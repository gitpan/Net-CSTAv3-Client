Net-CSTAv3-Client version 0.01
==============================

DESCRIPTION

This module implements (a part of) the Computer Supported Telecommunications
Applications (CSTA) protocol. It enables you to write perl programs which can
communicate with your Private Branch eXchange device (PBX) to, for example,
monitor calls to and from your own network.

Even though the CSTA protocol is defined in ECMA standards, vendors seem to
implement customized versions of it. This module was developed for a Siemens
HiPath PBX, most of the specification was obtained from the documentation of
the "Siemens HiPath OpenOffice" unit - available at
L<http://wiki.siemens-enterprise.com/index.php/HiPath_OpenOffice_ME_Offene_Schnittstellen>.

For now this module only implements a small subset of the functionality offered
by CSTA / Siemens' CSTA implementation - expect it to grow in future versions. :-)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Carp
  Convert::ASN1::asn1c

Of course to make use of this module you will need to have access to a PBX
which implements the CSTA phase 3 protocol. This module was developed for /
only tested with a Siemens HiPath PBX, so your results may vary.
